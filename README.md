A Chrome Extension for downloading books from Google Books URLs.

STILL UNDER WORK, as of 07-Jan-2020

## How to use?

1. Simply open the `preview page` of your targeted google book. This is the page, on which you can freely scroll through the previewed pages of the book. If not done already, scroll the book preview  to the top (first) page.

2. Now open the extension and click `Download` to start the download. The extension will first skim automatically through the book and processes the loaded resources into a single `PDF file`. The PDF will be automatically downloaded once the process is finished. 

## How to install?

#### TLDR

This repo is an unpacked Chrome extension. Goto `chrome://extensions`, toggle `Developer mode` and click `Load unpacked`

#### Detailed instructions

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open Google `Chrome browser`
3. Enter `chrome://extensions` (Sadly, I cannot link this Chrome page, as this page gets automatically blocked by Chrome, when accessed via links. This is probably due to safety reasons.)
4. On top right, turn on `Developer mode`
5. On top left, click `Load unpacked` and select the previously downloaded repoository in the file browser.
6. **Done.** Now the extension should appear on top right of your chrome browser, along with your other extensions.
